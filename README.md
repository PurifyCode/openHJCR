# openHJCR
Welcome to the openHJCR Repository! (open HTML, Javascript, (html) Canvas Renderer)
This repository tries to move away from regular renderers, like OpenGL/WebGL and Vulkan, for wider compatability.
Since this is open source, anyone can contribute to it!
# Implementing this in your pre-existing project
Copy the <body> and <style> sections and paste that into your HTML file. Make sure that there aren't two <body> tags. Also, download the "Dependencies" folder. "cube.js" is just an example script. Inside of your HTML file, add: `<script src="Dependencies/renderer.js">`.
# Why is this buggy?
I just have started this project 2 days ago, so don't expect anything to be perfect! Thank you, and if you would be so kind, please help contribute to the project! Thank you.
